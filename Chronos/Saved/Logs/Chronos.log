NTFS Journal has wrapped for volume 'C:'; the number of files written to this volume exceeded the buffer size of the journal and some entries were dropped.
If this happens frequently increase the buffer size of the journal:
Launch cmd.exe as admin and run command `fsutil usn createJournal C: m=<SizeInBytes>`
